# Script
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

# Writing Script 
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
 
## for example :Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking about them too much, for example you might be able to drive a car,
 cook breakfast, or send an email without a set of detailed instructions.
 
## Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
 You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle.

3. CODE EACH STEP 
 Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.
 
### Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 

### Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 

### To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

# OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
  
### mathematical operators
mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers, from school add, multiplie, subtract, and divide.
   1. 1 + 1 = 2
   2. 1 - 1 = 0
   3. 1 * 1 = 1
   4. 1 / 1 = 0

### String concatination
   to add 2 strings together i use  +
   var name = 'Mohammad'
   'hello ' +name
