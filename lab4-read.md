# A process that you can use when you are creating a new website.
  
  1. How to understand the audience your site may attract and what information they will expect to find on it.
  2. How to organize information so that visitors can find what they are looking for.
  3. Design theory for presenting information in a way that helps visitors achieve their goals.
  4. Design tips to help you create more attractive and professional sites.
  
 1. Who is this site for who is your audience ?
   Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. 
   one way to know this is to do a research and gather information and to do so you should start ask the right questions, some examples.
         * How often do they use the web?
         * Which country do your visitors live in?
         * What is the average income of visitors?
         * What level of education do they have?
         * What kind of device do they use to access the web?
         
   2. then i start by asking what they need from my wewbsite?
   3. after i define my audience and know what they do on website,
   i ask why they have visited my website ? what they needed ?
   3. Now I have the information analyzed, i build the wireframe.
   4. I create **SITE MAP** to plan the structure of the website.
   
## wireframes
   * low presentations of the website and how it will look to the user and give me insight on how organize the website.
   * i might need to use some information on more than one place depends on the information.
   * By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.
   * wireframes should not have colors and design because the website owner might start thinking about
   design and ignore the functionality of the website.
   * then i create mockups, and it's the future that tells the client how the website looks.


# HTML 5
   1. The HTML5 semantic elements clearly describe the purpose of the tag for the developer and the browser, search
     engines might place more weight on the content in an <article> element than that in the header or footer elements.
   
   * Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.
   * developers used to add each section in div and give it ID selector to indicate what is this container all about.   

   2. html5 semantic help the developer to understand and get clear picture about html structure.
       for example: nav tell the developer this is a navigation bar, artice tell this is an article
       
       * header element used to contain the site name and the main navigation mostly.
       * footer element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions.
