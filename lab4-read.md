   Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. 
   one way to know this is to do a research and gather information and to do so you should start ask the right questions, some examples.
         * How often do they use the web?
         * Which country do your visitors live in?

   3. after i define my audience and know what they do on website,
   i ask why they have visited my website ? what they needed ?
   3. Now I have the information analyzed, i build the wireframe.
   4. I create **SITE MAP** to plan the structure of the website.
   
## wireframes
   * low presentations of the website and how it will look to the user and give me insight on how organize the website.
   * i might need to use some information on more than one place depends on the information.
   * By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.

   design and ignore the functionality of the website.
   * then i create mockups, and it's the future that tells the client how the website looks.


# HTML 5
   1. The HTML5 semantic elements clearly describe the purpose of the tag for the developer and the browser, search
     engines might place more weight on the content in an <article> element than that in the header or footer elements.
   
   * Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.
   * developers used to add each section in div and give it ID selector to indicate what is this container all about.

       * footer element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions.
