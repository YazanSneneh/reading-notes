# growth mindset vs fixed mindset
   *Mindset* means how we view ourself and the world, how we think and see things.
    
    
## there are two types of mindset
 1. **growth mindset**
      People with *growth mindset* have traits help them grow and progress in life, 
      for example when you give them a puzzle to solve they will challenge themselves and keep trying until they solve it.
      
      #### some of their traits
       * they step up to the challenge.
       * they have confident in their ablilties.
       * they believe nothing is impossible.
       * they keep scratching the image until it become clear.
          
 2. **fixed mindset**
      it's the opposite of *growth mindset*, they believe they are who they are since the day they are born thus they don't try.
      
      #### some of their traits
       * they tend to have less confident.
       * they don't try to challenge themselves because they believe their disteny is fixed.
       * they keep complaining about life
