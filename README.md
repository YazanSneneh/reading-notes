# growth mindset vs fixed mindset
   * The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, 
   and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
   * Why? The aptly named growth mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue, especially in our work. When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better.
    
## Growth Mindset 
   * A **growth mindset** believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; **intelligence and talent are simply good starting points**.
   * A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
          
## Differences Between A Fixed and A Growth Mindset when Faced With :
   Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset.
   1. Challenges:
      I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it.

      * Fixed Mindset: **avoid** 
        1. I’m in a fixed mindset and avoiding the problem by giving up.
      * Growth Mindset: **Embrace**
        1. walk through the problem once again, bit by bit.
        2. look for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward.
        3. jot down clues as they come about.
        4. miraculously, begin to find root causes of the problem.
   
   2. Obstacles: 
     My first impulse when I hit a roadblock.
      
      * Fixed Mindset: **Lose Focus** 
        1. divert attention to something else. lose focus.
        2. just about anything to delay keeping at it and fighting through the discomfort.
        3. “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task.
      * Growth Mindset: **Presists*
        1.  recognizing what’s happening (I’m avoiding and losing focus).
        2.  make peace with it.
        3.  un-traps just enough of my gumption to do one more thing on the project.
        4.  Then another one more thing.
        5.  Eventually, enough momentum builds up and I’m back in the groove.

   3. Effort:
       troubles with cycling. When my alarm goes off at 5 A.M., the thought of going out on the bike is dreadful.
      
      * Fixed Mindset: **Views as fruitless**
        1. The temptation to stay in bed is strong, instant gratification monkey again.
        2. know the feeling of staying in bed won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later.
      * Growth Mindset: **No Pain No Gain**
        1. **no pain, no gain** is pure growth mindset!.
        2. on the mornings when I get up and ride? I feel better.
        3. It’s hard work, sure, and the good feeling isn’t instantaneous (sometimes it is).
        4. when the ride is over and my body feels better.
        5. spirit is stronger. I’m proud of myself, and that goes a long, long way.
      
   4. Criticism:
      Judge my days based on my mood at the end.
      My worst days are when I haven’t managed to get things together,
      I’ve procrastinated and wasted time,
      and I find myself with very little to look back on positively.
      
      * Fixed Mindset: **Avoid it**:
        1. haven’t managed to get things together
        2. procrastinated and wasted time.
        3. find myself with very little to look back on positively
     
      * Growth Mindset: **Learn from it**
      **ask myself two questions to gain growth mindset on criticism.**
        * What was the best part of the day? 
        * What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?

        **These questions help focus on all aspects of my day, the good and the bad. and they help internalize strategies for creating more good days going.**
        variations of these questions help me process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid (and it usually is), I can hold a mini-retrospective with myself.
        1. Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
        2. What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
      
   5. Success of Others:
      * Fixed Mindset: **See it as a threat**
        1. Jealous of people, thought were more successful or more intelligent.
        2. Fixed mindset leads you to see the success of others as a threat
      * Growth Mindset: **See it as inspiration**
        1. See others as dedicated colleagues with a passion for learning.
        2. Growth mindset encourages you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration.
