# Computer Architecture and Logic
   Any Computer in the world consist of following components. Memory, Processor, input and output devices
## Program 
   i set of instructions writting by a programmer using a tool known as programming langauges.
   for example if i want to caclulate the area of a rectangular i will proive following information
     1. height and width.
     2. equation to calculate the area.
     3. print the area on the screen.
   these known as instructions.
     
### Programmer 
  the techies who is living behind the screen and telling the computer what to do all day long.
  and most critical skill they should have is problem solving.
  then communicate with the computer.

### programming language
  is a tool the programmer use to communicate with the computer.
  
### programming language level
  there are 3 levels of programming languages in programming world and you will understand them later in here.
   1. high level language
     like C++ or java, easy to understand and use since they use human like language.
     they either interpreted like Java or compiled like C++.
   2. low level language
    known as assembly and it's hexa code hard to learn and close to machine langauge code.
   3. machine language
      it's 0 or 1 , when there is electrical signal it's 1 and when there is no signal it's 0.
# explination
  when programmer run program it will run in ram.
  then it read the file and recognize it's extention for example .cpp
  there is a program called compiler will compile it so low level langauge can understand it the cpp file and process it to the assembly.
  assembly will read file and translate it to machine code which is 0 or 1.
  inside CPU machine has transistors stacked next to each others.
  these transistor are keys or think of them as wires.
  if wire is open or not connected will evaluate to 0 which is no signal.
  if it's closed then will produce 1.
  then cpu show it on screen.
